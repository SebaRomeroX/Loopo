# Orchestration — multi-agent work

Part of the `arggon-cli` skill (`SKILL.md`). Non-trivial items are **orchestrated
by default**: a coordinator delegates them to subagents instead of working them
inline. Trivial items (one-line fixes, doc tweaks) stay inline. Full rules:
`ArggonManager/docs/agents.md` §Orchestration.

## Coordinator duties

- **Wave planning by file-disjointness:** group claimable items into waves whose
  members touch disjoint files/modules; items that would collide go in different
  waves.
- **Claim before dispatch:** claim every item you are about to delegate —
  `tools.arggon.start({ id, assignee, worktree: true })` (CLI: `arggon start <id>
--worktree`) — **before** launching its worker, then launch into the path the
  claim returned. That call is the worktree step: it takes the single-writer
  stamp, creates `../<repo>-<id>`, pre-builds the packages that copy owns and
  records `branch` + `worktree_path`. Never hand-roll `git worktree add` for a
  claim, never dispatch a worker as the first claimant, never claim an item you
  are not dispatching (unclaim it **and release it** —
  `tools.arggon.cleanup({ release: id })` / `arggon cleanup --release <id>`: the
  unclaim clears the assignee but leaves the claim's worktree, `.arggon.env` and
  claim stamp behind, and `--prune` cannot reap a `todo` item; the unclaim's own
  `claimFootprint` receipt names the release command), and read a start **refusal**
  as evidence,
  not a retry — `start` has no `--force`, and no refusal is a licence to route
  around it by hand.
- **Per-item worktrees:** one subagent per item, each in its own worktree — the
  recorded `worktree_path` on the item, never a `../<repo>-<id>` convention
  guess; no two subagents share a working tree.
- **Code review (lead architect):** review **every** subagent PR before merge
  against the review bar in `ArggonManager/docs/engineering.md` (architecture-first,
  conventions first, quality/security bar, tests travel with behavior, docs
  travel with code, scope stays on the item, **blocking smoke test**) plus the
  coordination specifics: surgical staging, no cross-item files, no unrelated
  reformatting, acceptance ticks honest. Change requests and verdicts go back via
  `arggon comment <item-id>` on the item — never as GitHub PR comments.
- **Merge verification:** after each subagent PR, verify the merge; resolve
  cross-item conflicts when waves overlap.
- **Tracker ownership:** claim conflicts, blocked items, follow-up filing, and
  final wave verification (`arggon validate` ok, `arggon doctor` clean).

## Subagent rules

- Work an item inside the worktree you were handed, and only when the item is
  **already claimed** — a coordinator that dispatches work claims it first, so
  confirm with `tools.arggon.show({ id, meta: true })` and never re-claim, never
  take over the stamp and never hand-roll a worktree. Claim it through `start`
  (never a bare `update --status in_progress`) only when you picked the item up
  yourself and no claim exists.
- Never flip your item `done` — completion is the coordinator's call after merge
  verification — and never reopen `done`/`cancelled` or steal a claim.
- Expect the coordinator's review and address change requests before merge.
- Come with smoke evidence for behavior changes: changed commands probed on a
  fixture (expected vs observed); UI changes browser-driven per ADR 0008 — the
  smoke gate blocks merge.
- Report findings back to the coordinator instead of filing tracker items — the
  coordinator consolidates and files.

## Worktrees in practice

`arggon start <id> --worktree` claims, creates (or attaches to) the worktree at
`../<repo-name>-<id>`, runs the claim commit/push inside it, and records
`worktree_path` on the item. Start prepares the worktree first — it mirrors the
primary checkout's `node_modules` as a per-worktree link farm when the worktree
lacks an install, so the repo's pre-commit gate can run (start never commits the
install; it is removed before a configured `x-worktree.post-start` hook runs, so
`npm ci` cannot reify through it and empty the primary install) — and a failure
after creation keeps the worktree and branch instead of deleting them (the error
names the failing step, path and remediation; re-running attaches). The workspace
packages the worktree also carries (`node_modules/@arggondev/lib -> ../../lib`) are
pointed at the worktree copy and pre-built with the package's own `build` script
before the claim commit when their declared entry is missing, so the spawned
CLI/tests run the branch's build; a copy that could not be built keeps the
primary's copy and is named by `linkedWorkspaces` in `--json` (re-read after the
hook). A worktree that must use a full local install can run `npm ci` (e.g. via
`x-worktree.post-start: npm ci`). Move the session into that path
(`session_move` in OpenCode V2) so every later command runs there. When the work
is merged, `arggon cleanup` lists stale worktrees and `--prune` removes them.

The claim, branch, PR and validate rules apply to subagents **unchanged**: same
commands, same gates, same never-list. The kernel enforces the rules; neither
role forks them.
